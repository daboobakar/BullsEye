# BullsEye

The objective of this simple game is to put the bull’s eye, which is on a slider that goes from 1 to 100, as close to a randomly chosen target value as you can. 

Since you can’t see the current value of the slider, you’ll have to “eyeball” it.
When you’re confident of your estimate you press the “Hit Me!” button and a popup will tell you what your score is.

The closer to the target value you are, the more points you score!

The game repeats until the player presses the “Start Over” which resets the score to 0.
